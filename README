    The ledmac package is for typesetting critical editions. It is a
LaTeX port, and extension, of the plain TeX EDMAC, TABMAC and EDSTANZA
macros. The ledpar package is an extension of ledmac enabling parallel
typesetting in columns or on facing pages. The ledarab package is
an extension enabling the use of arabic script, as implemented by ArabTeX, 
in critical editions (temporarily afoot.sty is provided to support regular 
footnotes in ArabTeX).

    Bug reports and suggestions may be welcome.

This package is versionned in github https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/

Please use the ledpar issues. https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/issues

    To install the ledmac package:
o run: latex ledmac.ins (which will generate ledmac.sty)
o Move ledmac.sty (and ledpatch.sty if it exists) to a location where 
  LaTeX will find it (for more information on this see the FAQ).

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a PDF file):
o run: latex ledmac.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist ledmac)
o run: latex ledmac.dtx
o Print ledmac.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 

    The *.eps files are example pages processed with the ledmac package.
They are included as figures in ledmac.dtx, which also contains the
source code for them.

    Installation of the other packages (via ledpar.ins and ledarab.ins)
is similar.
