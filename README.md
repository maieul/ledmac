#Overview
The reledmac package is for typesetting critical editions.  The reledpar package is an extension of reledmac enabling parallel typesetting in columns or on facing pages.

Reledmac and reledpar are successors of eledmac and eledpar, which were successor of ledmac and ledpar.
Ledmac was a LaTeX port, and extension, of the plain TeX EDMAC, TABMAC and EDSTANZA macros.

The package is available on [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/reledmac).

#Debug and feature requests

Suggestions and bug reports are welcome.

Maïeul Rouquette is the only one maintainer. To help him in his work, please follow these rules:

- Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/issues).
- Open *one issue for each problem*, even if problems are similar.
- Add a [minimal working example](http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=minxampl).
- If your report is really a bug, Maïeul Rouquette will open a "branch" to solve your problem. This branch will be called "issueXXX", where "XXX" is the issue number.
- Once the problem has a possible solution, Maïeul Rouquette will ask you to test the new branch:
	- Download the zip file of the branch (or, if you know Git, go to the branch there):
		- Go to [the project page](https://github.com/maieul/ledmac/).
		- Choose the correct branch in the "branch" menu.
		- Click on the cloud, in the right side.
	- Run the `.ins` files with pdflatex, to obtain the `.sty` files.
	- Put the `.sty` files with your test files (in the same folder).
	- Look on file issueXXX.tex get a MWE of the new feature.
	- Make your report.
