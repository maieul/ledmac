\title{Sectioning commands with critical notes in parallel pages}



{\let\newpage\relax\maketitle}
{\small
This file provides examples for using the sectioning command with eledpar. The section titles are in the line numbering, and have critical notes.

The left and right sides are put in parallel pages. Following the standard behavior of eledpar, only the left titles are put to the table of contents. 

We use the \verb+\eledxxx+ commands, each of them in their own \verb+\pstartâ€¦\pend+ group. 

Page breaks are manually added before chapter with \verb+\beforeeledchapter+.
