{\small
This file provides example of using sectioning command with elepar. The section title are  in the line numbering, and have critical notes. 

The left and right sides are put in parallel pages. Following the standard behavior of eledpar, only the left titles are put to the table of contents. 

We use the \verb+\eledxxx+ commands, each of them in their own \verb+\pstart…\pend+ group. 

Page clearings are manually added before chapter with \verb+\beforeeledchapter+.
