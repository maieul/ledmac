Little Lamb, who made thee\\
Dost thou know who made thee,\\
Gave thee life, and bid thee feed\\
By the stream and o'er the mead;\\
Gave thee clothing of delight,\\
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;\\
Gave thee such a tender voice,\\
Making all the vales rejoice?\\
Little Lamb, who made thee?\\
Dost thou know who made thee?

\pausenumbering

This is a line between the two stanzas that should \emph{not} be number, because it is prefaced with the \verb|\pausenumbering| command.

Little Lamb, I'll tell thee;\\
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee:\\
He is called by thy name,\\
For He calls Himself a Lamb\\
He is meek, and He is mild,\\
He became a little child.\\
I a child, and thou a lamb,\\
We are call\'ed by His name.\\
Little Lamb, God bless thee!\\
Little Lamb, God bless thee!
